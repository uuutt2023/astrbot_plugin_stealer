## 📢 Introduction

An [AstrBot](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot) entertainment plugin powered by multimodal AI. Automatically steals emojis from chat, classifies them with a vision model, and sends a mood-matching emoji during conversations to make Bot replies feel more human. Stealing and auto-sending can be toggled independently.

This plugin is fully open-source and free. Issues and PRs are welcome.

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Auto Steal** | Monitor group chat images, auto-collect by probability or cooldown, with optional content filtration |
| **Smart Classification** | Use VLM to identify image content and classify by emotion preset categories |
| **Emotion Matching** | Analyze the emotion of Bot replies and append a matching emoji |
| **LLM Proactive Selection** | LLM can search and send the best emoji via tool calls during conversation |
| **Dual-Mode Emotion Analysis** | LLM mode (lightweight post-reply analysis, doesn't modify the reply) / Passive tag mode (LLM directly tags emotion) |
| **WebUI Management** | View, search, delete, blacklist, and manage emojis with `public/local` scoping, origin-group display, and batch operations |
| **Group Filtering** | Whitelist/blacklist control over which groups allow stealing/sending |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Search and install `astrbot_plugin_stealer` in the AstrBot plugin manager.

### 2. Prerequisites

**A vision model is required.** The plugin relies on VLM for image classification. You can configure the global image caption model in AstrBot, or specify `vision_provider_id` in the plugin config.

### 3. Getting Started

```
/meme on        # Enable emoji stealing
/meme auto_on   # Enable auto-sending
```

Done stealing?

```
/meme off       # Disable stealing (collected emojis remain available)
```

### 4. WebUI Management

Open the plugin detail panel in the AstrBot Dashboard and click 「Emoji Manager」 to access the management page.

- **Browse**: Filter by category, search, and sort collected emojis.
- **Scope Management**: `public` for shared library, `local` for origin-group-only sending.
- **Batch Operations**: Move categories, delete, and set scopes in batch.
- **Single Upload**: Upload an image and use AI to auto-detect category and scene tags.
- **Batch Import**: Upload multiple emojis at once. **Category selection** and **Auto-analysis** are mutually exclusive:
  - **Select Category**: Saves images to the specified category without calling VLM.
  - **Auto-analysis**: VLM automatically identifies each image's category (high concurrent API calls).
- **Category Management**: Add, edit, and delete emoji categories.

> ⚠️ **High Concurrency Warning**: Auto-analysis processes multiple images concurrently and may trigger API rate limits. Batch your imports accordingly.

## 💡 Recommended Usage

### Fully Automatic (for token-rich setups)

**Enable auto-steal + auto-send**

1. Enable stealing: `/meme on`
2. Enable auto-send: `/meme auto_on`
3. The bot auto-collects and classifies group emojis
4. The bot appends mood-matched emojis to replies

> LLM mode: A lightweight model analyzes emotion after the reply, without modifying the reply content.
> Passive tag mode: The LLM directly tags emotion — faster but modifies the reply.

**LLM Proactive Selection**: The bot can search for the best emoji via tool calls during conversation.

### Semi-Automatic (for token-constrained setups)

**Manual emoji management**

1. Place emojis in `plugin_data/astrbot_plugin_stealer/categories/<category>/` manually
2. Or use WebUI batch upload with a specified category
3. The bot still auto-sends matching emojis (using existing categories only, no VLM calls)

### Precision Collection (for controlled setups)

**Targeted collection + WebUI management**

1. Use command: `/meme 偷` to enter 30-second forced collection mode
2. Or use WebUI batch import + auto-analysis
3. Manage via WebUI: view, edit, delete, set scopes

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings can be modified in the AstrBot admin panel.

### Stealing Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Enable emoji stealing** | `false` | Master toggle |
| **Steal mode** | `probability` | `probability` = roll chance per image / `cooldown` = enforce interval |
| **Steal probability** | `0.3` | Chance of stealing each received image (probability mode) |
| **Steal cooldown (seconds)** | `30` | Minimum interval between two steals (cooldown mode) |
| **Content filtration** | `false` | Filter inappropriate images; may increase processing time |

### Sending Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Auto-send emojis** | `false` | Auto-send emojis during conversation |
| **Emoji send probability** | `0.2` | Probability of auto-sending (0.0 ~ 1.0) |
| **Send as GIF** | `false` | Send as GIF (closer to native emoji style, slightly higher memory) |
| **Send delay (seconds)** | `5.0` | Delay before sending to avoid conflicts with message segmentation plugins. Set to 0 for immediate. |
| **Random delay** | `false` | Random delay between [delay] ~ [max delay] for more natural timing |
| **Max random delay (seconds)** | `8.0` | Upper bound for random delay |
| **Smart emoji selection** | `true` | Composite scoring; disable for completely random picks |

### Emotion Recognition

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Emotion recognition mode** | `true` | `true` = LLM mode (recommended, doesn't pollute chat) / `false` = passive tag mode |
| **Emotion analysis model** | `""` | Lightweight model for LLM mode; leave blank to use the current session default |

### Model Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vision model** | `""` | For image classification; leave blank to auto-use the global image caption model |
| **NapCat access token** | `""` | Only needed when auto-detection fails in special network setups |

### Group Filtering

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Send whitelist** | `[]` | Format: `group:<id>` or `user:<id>`. Non-empty = only whitelisted targets. |
| **Send blacklist** | `[]` | Can coexist with whitelist; priority controls conflict resolution. |
| **Send filter priority** | `whitelist_first` | `whitelist_first` or `blacklist_first` |
| **Steal whitelist** | `[]` | Format: `group:<id>` or `user:<id>`. |
| **Steal blacklist** | `[]` | Can coexist with whitelist. |
| **Steal filter priority** | `whitelist_first` | `whitelist_first` or `blacklist_first` |

### Storage & Advanced

| Setting | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Max emoji count** | `100` | Storage limit; oldest emojis are cleaned when exceeded |
| **VLM classification prompt** | `""` | Custom prompt for VLM emotion classification |
| **VLM classification prompt (with filtration)** | `""` | Prompt used when content filtration is enabled |

### WebUI

The management page is served through the AstrBot Dashboard plugin page system. Click 「Emoji Manager」 in the plugin detail panel to access it. No additional port or password configuration is needed.

## 🔄 Emotion Analysis Modes

| | LLM Mode (recommended) | Passive Tag Mode |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **How it works** | A lightweight model analyzes the reply's sentiment in the background | Inject a prompt that makes the LLM insert `&&emotion&&` tags into its reply |
| **Effect on replies** | ✅ Doesn't modify the LLM's original reply | ❌ Temporarily inserts tags (cleaned before sending) |
| **Best for** | Daily use, keeping conversation natural | When you want the LLM to precisely control emotion classification |

> ⚠️ **Run `/reset` after switching modes** to clear the conversation context, otherwise the LLM may carry over the old mode's output patterns.

## 🎮 Command Reference

All commands use the `/meme` prefix.

### Display Commands (everyone)

### LLM Tool Calls (triggered automatically in conversation)

| Tool | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `search_emoji` | LLM searches for matching emoji candidates |
| `send_emoji_by_id` | LLM selects and sends an emoji from the candidate list |

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Deleting a category via WebUI** also deletes all associated image files. Use with caution.
- With `send_emoji_as_gif` enabled, very large images converted to GIF may cause memory spikes. Turn it off on low-memory environments.
- A **vision model (VLM)** is required. Without one, the plugin's core functions won't work.

### 📝 Prompt Format Update

Since `v2.4.5+`, the core classification prompt uses a **strict JSON output format** for more stable and accurate parsing.

If you customized the prompt in an earlier version, clear the `VLM classification prompt` field in the plugin config panel and reload the plugin.

The old pipe-delimited format is still compatible, but the JSON format is more reliable.
